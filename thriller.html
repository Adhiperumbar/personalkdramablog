        <h2>🕵️ Thriller K-Dramas</h2>
        <p class="intro">There's nothing quite like a Korean thriller to keep you on the edge of your seat! I'm obsessed with the way K-dramas master the art of the plot twist, the mind games between characters, and those morally grey protagonists who make you question everything. The suspense is next-level, the pacing is perfect for binge-watching, and the psychological depth is just *chef's kiss*. From crime dramas to psychological thrillers, these shows will have you guessing until the very last episode!</p>
